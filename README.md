# IV-POGM

The IV-POGM (Intravenous Perioperative Glucose Monitor) system is developed by MSDII Team 24271. The device is capable of continuously monitoring glucose levels of a patient during surgery. During initial setup, the allotted ranges before alerting hypoglycemia or hypoglycemia. Glucose measurements are taken on a set sampling frequency and displayed to the user. If values exceed the set range, visual and audio alerts will be made. Once the measuring session is complete, a log of data will be exported from the device.

## Usage

![Screenshot of project in STM32CubeIDE](CubeIDE.png)

With the project open in STM32CubeIDE, clicking the run button will flash the project to the microprocessor. An STLINK-V3MINIE was used to connect a PC to the PCB. 

All peripheral files (adc, gpio, i2c, etc.) were generated by the CubeIDE after configuration in the .ioc file. System functionality is defined and implemented in main.c. All user-made files associated with the LCD display (ILI9341_STM32, GFX_STM32, cd_driver, lcd_ui) will need to be heavily debugged / redone. Attempts to utilize this section of the code were unsuccessful.
