# IV-POGM

The IV-POGM (Intravenous Perioperative Glucose Monitor) system is developed by MSDII Team 24271. The device is capable of continuously monitoring glucose levels of a patient during surgery. During initial setup, the allotted ranges before alerting hypoglycemia or hypoglycemia. Glucose measurements are taken on a set sampling frequency and displayed to the user. If values exceed the set range, visual and audio alerts will be made. Once the measuring session is complete, a log of data will be exported from the device.

## Usage

```python
import foobar

# returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('word')

# returns 'geese'
foobar.pluralize('goose')

# returns 'phenomenon'
foobar.singularize('phenomena')
```

^Replace this with a better example of how the device is used from start to finish - might not even be code^
